## Why AGPL-3.0 with Future MIT Option?  

This project is licensed under AGPL-3.0 to:  
- Prevent corporations from privatizing or profiting off improvements to a mental-health tool without giving back to the community.  
- Ensure all derivatives (even hosted services) remain open-source.  

However, I reserve the right to relicense under MIT in the future if:  
- The plugin struggles to gain adoption due to AGPLâ€™s strictness.  
- The community overwhelmingly prefers a more permissive license.  

**I will never sell exclusive rights to this code.**
